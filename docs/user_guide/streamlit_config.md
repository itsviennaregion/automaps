# Streamlit Configuration

To change the configuration of Streamlit inside your autoMaps project, use the approach
of creating a global config file `.streamlit/config.toml`, as described in the
[Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration).

You may, for example, want to change the server port, the log format, or the UI theme.
